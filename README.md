Data collection
Inspired by comprehensive and fully open access zircon age and isotope databases such as Puetz (2019) and Puetz and Condie (2021), our approach is to provide: 1) as much metadata as possible, including GPS locations for all samples, and 2) as much raw unfiltered data as possible. This approach means that subsequent workers can make best use of the database, utilising their own criteria for data acceptance, and using age and spatial information to correct for temporal and spatial bias (Keller and Schoene, 2012). Although subjective, we argue the present compilation is now large enough to be able to compare regional trends. This in critical to understanding whether averaged global trends truly represent fundamental changes in Earth evolution.

Correlative age data were collected for a subset of samples, generally where they were provided in the same format and/or in the same data tables as the trace elements. For these records, the choice of age (i.e. 207Pb/206Pb or 206Pb/238U) can be chosen, and the discordance recalculated, so that other users can make their own choices. For many data, the age provided in our database corresponds to the ‘best age’ provided with the original publication; these are commonly already pre-filtered for discordant data. Our compilation includes the most commonly measured elements; some omissions include Li, Sn, Co, Mo and W, which are restricted to very few studies thus far. Caution should be placed over the use of Pb, since many users do not clarify whether their Pb concentrations refer to measurement of 208Pb, 207Pb, 206Pb, or total Pb, and whether these are age corrected.

The database can be downloaded from both Figshare and Github at the following links.

The database is not fixed, and mistakes noticed by ourselves or by others will be corrected and the database updated.

Data filtering
All raw data are provided under the heading Complete Database v1, and filtered data are provided under the heading Filtered Database v1. The following criteria were used to remove data in the filtered database: LREEi (Dy/Nd+Dy/Sm) <10, Ti ppm >100, P ppm >3000, La ppm >5, and Al ppm >1000. Age discordance was calculated using the relative difference in 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U ratios, and 207Pb/235U and 207Pb/206Pb ratios, where provided. Where data are compiled for multiple ages, 207Pb/206Pb ages are used for samples >1400 Ma, and 206Pb/238U ages for samples <1400 Ma. Data with discordance greater than 20% are removed within the filtered database, using the 207Pb/206Pb vs 206Pb/238U discordance for ages >1400 Ma, and the 207Pb/235U vs. 206Pb/238U discordance for ages <1400 Ma. Plotting in all figures utilised the filtered database.
